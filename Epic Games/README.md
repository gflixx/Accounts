### Middlemen

How does it work?

- Buyer or seller pays the transaction and middleman fees
- Seller gives the account information to the middleman
- Middleman verifies that the account information is what was agreed upon
- Middleman secures the email account by changing the password and recovery address, or changes the email address linked to the Epic Games account to a new email address that he creates
- Middleman confirms to the buyer that the account is as agreed upon and has been secured
- Buyer pays the seller directly
- Seller confirms payment receipt with middleman
- Middleman releases account info to buyer

What could go wrong when using a middleman?

- The middleman is an alt account or friend of the seller - lose all the money
- The middleman mis-judges the information - e.g.: the email address belongs to a school and can be reclaimed - lose all the money
- The seller doesn't deliver the goods - lose the middleman fees

30% fail rate

### NFA

If you only bought the password to the Epic Games account, you never had full access. The seller can click on the "forgot password" link at any time and reclaim the account by following the reset password link sent to his email and changing the password.

### Account recovery

#### Email account recovery

So everything went well after you bought the account! But a few days later the Epic Games and email account passwords no longer work.

The seller may have recovered the email account by contacting support at the email provider.

If the email account domain belongs to a school or university, e.g.: xx@harvard.edu - the seller can go there in person and have them create a new password.

If the email account belongs to a private domain, e.g.: xx@sellersdomain.com - the seller can just reset the password for himself as administrator of the domain.

If the email account was created by the seller, the seller can contact support and claim that the account was hacked to reclaim the account, e.g.:

#### Epic Games account recovery

#### Epic Games account deleted

So everything went well after you bought the account! But a few days later when logging into the Epic Games account a message appears saying the account was deleted.

Epic Games may have picked up on the violation of their terms of service (no selling accounts) and soft-deleted the account.

The account recovery information will be required to re-activate the account. Or assistance from the initial email address on the account, e.g.:
